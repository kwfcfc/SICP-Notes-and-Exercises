* Order of Growth
1. Order of growth might be represented as a function that requires input n,
 and outputs some number represent the resource of time of space
 required to solve the problem.
2. Let R(n) be the amount of resources the process
 requires for a prooblem of size n.
3. If there are positive constants k1 and k2independent of n:
 k_1f(n)<= R(n) <= k_2f(n)
 for *any sufficiently large value of n.* Now we call it R(n)=𝛉(f(n)).
4. It is just a rough measurement for how the required resources change
 as the size n grows. Mainly, it's about the largest grower of size n.
 For instance, the order of growth of a polynomial expression will
 only rely on the highest power of it.
