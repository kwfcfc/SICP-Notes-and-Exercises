* Higher-order procedures
** Concept and usage
1. This kind of procedures are at a higher level of abstraction than usual procedures. The main difference in between is that higher-order procedures receive procedures as their arguments. Therefore, this kind of procedures can be described as a set of procedures.
** Back to the recursive square root
1. The comparsion of iteration and recursion. Time complexity and space complexity.
   1. However, the difficulty is how to rewrite a program from recursion to iteration. (because usually iteration is more efficient than recursion.)
2. Damp-average
