;; a. How many times is the procedure p applied
;; when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

;; 5 times.

;; b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a
;; function of a) used by the process generated by the sine
;; procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

;; Since each time a is divided by 3, it is a kind of logarithm decrease. The order of growth in time is O(log n).

;; Each time the procedure p is called the register needs to remember the value of a. 
;; Therefore, as "a" decreases in logarithm
