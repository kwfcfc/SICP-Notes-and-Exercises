* How to analyze the runtime of a procedure
** The inaccuracy of runtime
1. It is quite impossible to find the accurate runtime of a procedure because
 it is often disturbed by noise, sometimes it is even to 0.1s for
 each procedure.
2. A simple way to fight against the random noise is massive tests.
You can run the timing procedure for 1000 times and average the noise.
Therefore, for now I haven't design a procedure that return the runtime better
than just test the runtime for once.
